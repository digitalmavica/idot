## Closing of Google Code ##
You can download zip files with source and binary code and learning materials from
my web site: [software tools](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/software/index.html)
and [files associated with textbooks](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/books/index.html).

If you wish to initiate a collaborative development, the projects are also available as repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/motib?tab=repositories).

## Overview ##
iDot enables incremental display of directed graphs written in the dot language of Graphviz.

iDot was developed for use with the SpinSpider software tool for automatically generating state diagrams from Promela programs for the Spin model checker, and the VN software tool for generating computations in nondeterministic finite automata. However, the software is released as an independent tool that is depends only on the dot language and layout software.
